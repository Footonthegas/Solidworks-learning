SolidWorks Portfolio
This repository serves as a professional record of my technical development and project work in Computer-Aided Design (CAD). It documents a systematic progression in SolidWorks, with a core focus on mechanical design fundamentals, parametric part modeling, complex assemblies, and standardized engineering documentation. This portfolio is maintained to demonstrate technical proficiency, design intent, and a disciplined approach to mechanical engineering challenges.

Overview

The objective of this repository is to provide a transparent view of my growth as a designer through:

Academic & Practical Progression: A chronological record of skill acquisition from core modeling to advanced system design.
Daily Technical Logs: Incremental practice models focused on specific feature sets and geometric constraints.
Applied Engineering Projects: Design solutions modeled after real-world mechanical components and systems.
Design Methodology: Explicit documentation of the "design intent" and engineering logic behind each model.

Every project within this repository is developed with a commitment to accuracy, manufacturability, and adherence to industry-standard engineering practices.

Modeling: Parametric part design, advanced sketching, and fully defined constraint management.
System Integration: Bottom-up and top-down assembly design, including interference detection and motion analysis.
Engineering Graphics: 2D technical drawings, orthographic projections, and dimensioning standards.
Advanced Features: Multi-body part modeling, surfacing, and configuration management.
Design Strategy: Creating robust, rebuild-ready models through stable parent-child relationships and parametric variables.

Learning Methodology
I utilize a methodical, industry-aligned approach to skill development.
Consistency: Daily modeling sessions to refine speed and technical accuracy.
Logical Structuring: Prioritizing a clean FeatureManager design tree to ensure models are easily editable and production-ready.
Self-Evaluation: Documenting key takeaways and technical hurdles for every project to ensure continuous refinement.
Verification: Regularly checking mass properties, material assignments, and interference to align digital models with physical reality.

Repository Purpose
This portfolio is utilized as:
Professional Record: A technical archive for internships, academic evaluations, and future professional roles in mechanical design.
Learning Log: A centralized repository for revisiting complex modeling techniques and design patterns.
Benchmark Portfolio: Documentation of my readiness for certification-level design tasks and collaborative engineering environments.
